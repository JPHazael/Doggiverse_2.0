WELCOME TO DOGGIVERSE!!!
__________________________________________________________________________________________

Doggiverse is a social networking app that is designed for those days when you don't want to read any articles, look at your friends' vacation photos, or engage in political debates. Doggiverse is an app that is focused on one thing, cute dogs. The app allows all users to share dog photos with other users. Users can like posts, if they feel so inclined. If a post does not contain a dog photo, users can flag that post. If three users flag a post that post will be removed. Once a user likes or flags a post, those features will be disabled, this is to prevent a single user from liking or flagging one post multiple times.Further, users are not able to like or flag their own posts. Tapping on a users profile will display all of their posts. Furthermore, the app allows users to search for one another. Finally, Doggiverse's meme editor allows users to turn their dog photos into hilarious memes.


DEVELOPER NOTES
__________________________________________________________________________________________

- The app relies on Google Firebase to handle all of its backend. The app employs features of Firebase Authorization, the Firebase Real-Time Database, and Firebase Storage.

-The app uses custom Collection and Table View Cells, UIButtons and a custom HMSegmented Controller. A drop-in replacement for UISegmentedControl mimicking the style of the segmented control used in Google Currents and various other Google products. 

-All user-generated memes and login information are stored in Core Data.


-Once an image has been downloaded it is cached and retrieved using Kingfisher. Kingfisher is a lightweight, pure-Swift library for downloading and caching images from the web that dramatically improves image load-time and user experience.

- The app also uses Firebase Database Persistence to maintain usability even in suboptimal network conditions.

-The app also uses Reachability to check detect the user’s internet connection status before making network requests.
